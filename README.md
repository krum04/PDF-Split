# PDF Splitter
![](https://github.com/krum04/PDF-Split/blob/master/images/PDF%20Split.PNG?raw=true)

## Overview

I had the need to seperate a 230 page employee performance report into 71 sepearte PDFs. I then would need to name each individual PDF with the staff member's name. I wrote this script to crawl the PDF and identify pages relevant to each staff member and split the file based on the staff's name at the top of their section.

## To-Do

* Identify names by the unique font used for staff's name so I can remove the teacher list field
* Create a status bar
* Refactor the split() function
* Add requirments.txt
